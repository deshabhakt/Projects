In this project I've worked on covid-19 database. The data availabe was from January-2020 till Decemeber-2020.

My main Objective was to find following things:

1. Filtering the month in which heighest people got infected by COVID-19
2. Obtaining state in which survival rate is high
3. finding states which had death rate more than 1%

For finding these things, first I've done preprocessing on covid-19 database.
The database had day-cumulative case count for each state. So, my main focus while data-processing was to get per day case count for each state and also create a generalized data pipeline which can be used for other similar covid-19 databases.

Finally for finding above things we have used python dictonaries.

All these things can be easily understood from jupyter notebook provided alongside with this file.
